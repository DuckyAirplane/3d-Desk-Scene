# 3d-Desk-Scene
"Final project for CS-330: Computational Graphics and Visualization. A C++ and OpenGL program that creates a textured 3D scene with lighting, camera navigation, and interactive controls."

For this project, I built out a full 3D scene and documented the design choices behind it. My process was pretty simple: break the work into smaller parts, build one thing at a time, and test as I went. Starting with the objects, then adding textures, lighting, and camera movement helped keep things from getting overwhelming.

I learned a lot about working in 3D space—like how small changes in lighting or texture can completely change how real something feels. Iteration was huge here; I’d constantly tweak positions, shading, or controls until it looked and felt right. By the end, my coding style also improved: cleaner structure, better commenting, and more focus on making the project easier to adjust later.

Overall, this course gave me a better understanding of how graphics really work under the hood. These skills aren’t just useful for games—they’ll carry over into any kind of visualization or interactive project I work on in the future, both in school and professionally.
